This repository contains the backend server for the Exoplanet Hunter AI, a full-stack application designed to classify celestial objects from the NASA Kepler dataset. The API serves a trained machine learning model and provides rich, contextual data for a frontend client.

This project was developed for the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge.

‚ú® Key Features
Multi-Class Classification: Predicts if a Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) is a Confirmed Exoplanet, Planetary Candidate, or False Positive.

User-Friendly Model: Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier trained on a curated set of the 12 most predictive and intuitive features for ease of use.

Model Explainability: Integrates the SHAP library to explain why the model made a specific decision by identifying the most influential features for each prediction.

Rich Data Endpoints: The API provides a wealth of contextual data for each prediction, including:

A simulated light curve plot (as a base64 string).

Data for a 2D star system visualization.

Habitable zone status (Too Hot, Habitable, or Too Cold).

A comparison to a similar, famous real-world exoplanet.

Performance Metrics: A dedicated endpoint serves key performance metrics of the currently deployed model.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, SHAP, Pandas, NumPy

Plotting: Matplotlib

Production Server: Gunicorn

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip and venv

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Windows:

Bash

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
macOS / Linux:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Add Model and Data Files
This repository does not store the large trained model files. You must generate them by running the provided Jupyter/Colab training notebook. After running the notebook, place the following downloaded files into the root of this project folder:

model_multiclass.pkl (the trained model)

scaler_multiclass.pkl (the data scaler)

feature_names_multiclass.pkl (the list of model features)

metrics.json (the model performance metrics)

famous_exoplanets.json (the comparison data)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
To run the Flask development server for local testing:

Bash

python app.py
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

To run with the production server (Gunicorn):

Bash

gunicorn app:app
